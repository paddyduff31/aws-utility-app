# aws-utility-app

Super simple utility app for getting information from aws.  

## Setup
- Copy example env and save as .env
- Add your environment variables
- Run npm install to add dependancies
- Run npm start to run.

I have made this super simple and you can just change the method being called by changing at the bottom of the server file
